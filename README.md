Problem Statement:
●Electric vehicles (EVs) have undergone significant transformations from early innovations in the 19th century to remarkable advancements in the 21st century. Initially popular in the early 1900s, EVs lost market share to gasoline-powered cars but saw renewed interest during the 1970s oil crisis. Today, they represent a growing segment of the automotive industry, driven by technological advancements, environmental concerns, and market dynamics.

●Early electric vehicles, such as those built by Robert Anderson in the 1830s, were powered by non-rechargeable batteries. By the early 1900s, electric vehicles like those from the Detroit Electric Car Company held a significant market share, favored for their quiet operation and ease of use. However, the rise of affordable gasoline cars, facilitated by innovations like the electric starter and Henry Ford's mass production techniques, led to a decline in EV popularity.

●The 1970s oil crisis renewed interest in alternative energy vehicles, leading to experimental models like the Sinclair C5 and General Motors EV1. The Sinclair C5, launched in 1985, was a small electric vehicle intended for urban commuting but failed commercially due to its limited speed and range. The GM EV1, produced in the late 1990s, was praised for its technology but discontinued due to high costs and limited infrastructure.

●The 21st century marked a resurgence for EVs, with advancements in battery technology and increasing environmental awareness. Companies like Tesla played a pivotal role in popularizing EVs, and major automotive manufacturers followed suit, leading to a diverse range of electric vehicles on the market today.

€There are three main types of electric vehicle powertrains:

●Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): Fully electric vehicles powered by batteries, offering a range of 100 to 400+ miles on a single charge. BEVs are environmentally friendly with zero tailpipe emissions and require less maintenance due to fewer moving parts. Examples include the Tesla Model 3 and Nissan Leaf.

●Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs): Vehicles that use hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity, emitting only water vapor. FCEVs have fast refueling times and long ranges (300-400+ miles), but they face challenges with hydrogen infrastructure and production costs. Examples include the Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo.

●Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): Vehicles that combine an electric motor with a traditional internal combustion engine. PHEVs can operate in electric-only mode for short trips and switch to hybrid mode for longer distances. They offer flexibility and reduced emissions but still rely on fossil fuels. Examples include the Toyota Prius Prime and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV.

●The future of electric mobility is promising, with continued advancements expected to drive sustainability and innovation in the transportation sector. The growing adoption of EVs, supported by improvements in battery technology, charging infrastructure, and governmental incentives, highlights their potential to reshape the automotive landscape.
